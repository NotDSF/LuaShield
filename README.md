# LuaShield-Rewrite
LuaShield is a whitelist service for Roblox

## Why release it?
I've decided it would be for my best interests if I quit development for a while to focus on my general mental health, not only that but this project is also a great learning resource for people looking to get into whitelist development and I hope it can be used ethically. Have fun!

## Why quit?
Development in general used to be something in my life which was an escape from all my problems, it used to be my little bubble and I enjoyed it, I've learnt a lot, I've met some great people who I'll never forget, but sometimes you can't keep continuing to work on things which don't interest you or you aren't particually happy about and has a big strain on your mental health. This isn't the complete end, I would just like to move onto bigger things which are more exicting and I have more motivation for. It was a great 4 years of my life doing this shit, but I'm nearly 16 and I can't keep doing this shit, it got boring a year ago and recently I've just grown apart and my life has improved significally, sometimes you have to put yourself first. Enjoy the release, probably my most passionate project released to you all. Goodbye
